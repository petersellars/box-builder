Box-Builder will enable me to provision and manage development environments using Puppet.

Initial work will be on the installation of a base box builder.
- VeeWee
- Packer

Virtual Environments to support:
- KVM/QEMU
- LXC
- VirtualBox
- VMWare

Cloud Environments to support:

On a machine wishing to use Box-Builder it is assumed only Puppet and Git are pre-requisites
